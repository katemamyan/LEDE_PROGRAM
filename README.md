# 🗽 Lede Program 2025 – My Data Journalism Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the [Lede Program 2025](https://journalism.columbia.edu/lede-program) – a 10-week intensive data journalism course at Columbia University. This program brings together coding, data analysis, and journalistic storytelling, and this space is where I’ll be documenting my progress.

## 📚 About the Program
The Lede Program is designed for journalists who want to expand their technical skill set. Over the summer, we dive deep into:
- Python programming
- Web scraping
- Working with APIs
- Data analysis
- Visualization and mapping
- Data-driven storytelling

## 💻 What's in This Repo?
This repository contains:
- 🧠 Homework assignments (yes, the painful ones too)
- 🛠️ Code experiments and side projects
- 🌐 Scraping scripts and API integrations
- 📊 Data visualizations and maps
- ✨ Notes, snippets, and lessons learned

## 🧭 Why I'm Doing This
This is more than just a course—it's a personal challenge, a creative journey, and a career leap. I’ll be learning, failing, debugging, and growing publicly here. If you’re also learning data journalism or just curious about the process, I hope this repo helps or inspires you.
